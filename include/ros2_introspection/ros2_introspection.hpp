   * @brief deserializeIntoFlatContainer takes a raw buffer of memory and extract information from it.
   *  This data is stored in two key/value vectors, FlatMessage::value and FlatMessage::name.
   * It must be noted that the key type is StringTreeLeaf. this type is not particularly user-friendly,
   * but allows a much faster post-processing.
   *
   * IMPORTANT: this approach is not meant to be used with use arrays such as maps, point clouds and images.
   * It would require a ridicoulous amount of memory and, franckly, make little sense.
   * For this reason the argument max_array_size is used.
   *
   * This funtion is almost always followed by applyNameTransform, which provide a more human-readable
   * key-value representation.
   *
   * @param msg_identifier   String ID to identify the registered message (use registerMessageDefinition first).
   * @param buffer           raw memory to be parsed.
   * @param flat_container_output  output to store the result. It is recommended to reuse the same object multiple times to
   *                               avoid memory allocations and speed up the parsing.
   * @param max_array_size   Usually we want to avoid special cases like maps and images, which contain very large arrays.
   *                         max_array_size is used to skip these arrays that are too large.
   *
   * return true if the entire message was parsed or false if parts of the message were
   * skipped because an array has (size > max_array_size)
